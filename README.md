AS OF 2021 FB NO LONGER SUPPORTS PAGE SCRIPTING AS DONE HERE.

This is a small python script I made for use in one of my small side-projects.

It just makes it easier for me to post a meme a day on a FB page, without me
having to log onto the page, find a meme, copy paste and do all that jazz.

You will have to fill in manually the details of all the accounts you use however
before the script will run.
